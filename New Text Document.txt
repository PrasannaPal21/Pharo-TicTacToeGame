Below is a high-level, step-by-step outline of the project structure and classes for an interactive Tic Tac Toe game in Pharo. No code is provided at this stage—just a clear breakdown of each component and how they fit together. You can follow these prompts as a checklist to build the project.

---

### **Step 1: Create a New Model**

- **Model Name:** TicTacToeGame  
- **Prefix (suggested):** TTT  
- **Structure:**  
  - Package: `TicTacToeGame-Model`  
  - Main model class (e.g., `TTTModel`)

---

### **Step 2: Define the Core Data Classes**

#### **2.1. TTTCell Class**

- **Purpose:** Represents a single cell on the Tic Tac Toe board.
- **Instance Variables:**  
  - `state` — Indicates the current marker in the cell (e.g., `#empty`, `#X`, or `#O`).
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Hold and update its state.
  - Provide access to its state (getters/setters).

#### **2.2. TTTBoard Class**

- **Purpose:** Represents the Tic Tac Toe board and manages game logic.
- **Instance Variables:**  
  - `cells` — A collection (e.g., an array or ordered collection) holding 9 `TTTCell` instances.
  - `currentPlayer` — Tracks whose turn it is (e.g., `#X` or `#O`).
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Initialize the board by creating 9 cells.
  - Manage cell marking logic (i.e., a method to mark a cell when a player makes a move).
  - Switch the current player after each move.
  - Check win/draw conditions and announce a win or reset the game as needed.
  
---

### **Step 3: Define the Model Class**

#### **TTTModel Class**

- **Purpose:** Acts as the overall simulation/model container.
- **Instance Variables:**  
  - `board` — An instance of `TTTBoard`.
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Initialize the model and create the game board.
  - Create the grid (if using a simulation framework like Cormas) and link grid cells with board cells.
  - Provide an entry point (e.g., an `openGameUI` method) to launch the interactive game.

---

### **Step 4: Define the User Interface (UI) Classes Using Morphic**

#### **4.1. TTTCellMorph Class**

- **Purpose:** A UI component representing an individual cell on the board.
- **Instance Variables:**  
  - `modelCell` — The corresponding `TTTCell` from the game model.
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Render the cell’s current state (empty, X, or O).
  - Handle user interaction (e.g., mouse click) and forward the event to update the model.

#### **4.2. TTTBoardMorph Class**

- **Purpose:** A UI container for the Tic Tac Toe board.
- **Instance Variables:**  
  - `board` — The instance of `TTTBoard` that this UI represents.
- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Arrange and display nine `TTTCellMorph` instances in a 3×3 grid.
  - Serve as the main interactive UI for the game.
  - Handle high-level UI events (like a reset or showing the current player's turn).

---

### **Step 5: Define Integration Points and Workflow**

1. **Model Initialization:**
   - `TTTModel` creates an instance of `TTTBoard`.
   - `TTTBoard` initializes its 9 cells and sets the starting player.
2. **Grid Creation (if using Cormas simulation):**
   - `TTTModel` creates a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns.
   - Each grid cell is linked to a corresponding `TTTCell` from the `TTTBoard` instance.
3. **User Interface Launch:**
   - A method (e.g., `openGameUI` in `TTTModel`) instantiates `TTTBoardMorph` and sets it up with the `TTTBoard`.
   - The UI morph is then opened in the Pharo world for user interaction.
4. **User Interaction Flow:**
   - When a user clicks a cell (handled in `TTTCellMorph`), the event is sent to the board to mark that cell.
   - After marking, the board switches the player and checks win conditions.
   - The UI updates to reflect the new state (cell markers, current player, etc.).

---

### **Step 6: Plan for Future Enhancements**

- **Win Conditions:**  
  - Define clear logic in `TTTBoard` to check rows, columns, and diagonals for a win or draw.
  - Provide visual feedback or a pop-up to announce the game result.
  
- **UI Improvements:**  
  - Display current player information.
  - Add a reset or new game button.
  - Improve cell rendering with colors or animations.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Ensure the UI gracefully handles invalid moves (e.g., clicking an already marked cell).
  - Maintain consistency between model and UI state.
